# AdamSkI2003's random things
Just some random scripts I made. I'll be adding new scripts to the repo as I make them.
# List of files
**m3u** - creates an .m3u file for playing every audio file in a folder (in alphabetical order, I assumed numbered files). Pass folder path as argument. Will use current working directory if no argument is passed.  
**Create .m3u file** - The **m3u** script adapted to work as a nemo script. You can change `$NEMO_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI` to `$NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI` for Nautilus compatibility.
